### Hey, Im Javi! 👋

### I'm a Software Engineer Intern at [General Motors 🚗](https://www.gm.com/) and a senior CS undergraduate at [Princeton 🐯](https://www.princeton.edu/).

Recently, I've been working on:
* SolScript.AI, a fine-tuned LLM on [etherscan](https://etherscan.io/) contracts 🦄 to generate smart contracts. Our model uses Chain of Thought and a critiquing LLM as an RL agent to minimize vulnerabilities.
* Gradient-Based Stiffness Optimization, using a finite element analysis with [FEniCS](https://fenicsproject.org/) to conduct an empirical evaluation across various interlocking joints 🏭.
* PUAM, a mobile app for Princeton's art museum built in Flutter with a Flask & SQL backend hosted on AWS 📱.
* CipherP2P, an innovative chrome extension that enables efficient p2p file sharing 📁. Built on Go, we designed a webRTC network built with a simplistic UI and efficient file protocol.
