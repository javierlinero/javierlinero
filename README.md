### Hey , Im Javi! 👋

### I'm a Software Engineer Intern at[General Motors 🚗](https://www.gm.com/).

Recently, I've been working on:
* SolScript.AI, a fine-tuned LLM on [etherscan](https://etherscan.io/) contracts 🦄, to generate smart contracts using Chain of Thought and a critiquing LLM as an RL agent to minimize vulnerabilities.
* Gradient-Based Stiffness Optimization, using a finite element analysis with [FEniCS](https://fenicsproject.org/) to conduct an empirical evaluation across various interlocking joints 🏭.
* PUAM, a mobile app for Princeton's art museum built in Flutter with a Flask & SQL backend hosted on AWS 📱.
* CipherP2P, an innovative chrome extension that enables efficient p2p file sharing 📁 using a designed webRTC network built on Go and hosted on Heroku, with a simplistic UI yet extensive file protocol.
