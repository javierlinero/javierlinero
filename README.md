### Hey, Im Javi! 👋

### I'm a Software Engineer and a senior CS undergraduate at [Princeton 🐯](https://www.princeton.edu/). 

I'm passionate about building scalable solutions focusing on backend applications, and have recently been involved in:
* **[Cardmania.org](https://cardmania.org)**: A dynamic palace card game platform boasting a Svelete + DaisyUI (TailwindCSS) frontend and a Flask + SocketIO backend, currently serving over 800 players and deployed on AWS with cloudflared tunneling.
* **PUAM**: A mobile app for Princeton University's Art Museum, built in Flutter with a Flask & PostgreSQL backend hosted on AWS 📱, designed to enhance user engagement through personalized art recommendations.
* **SolScript.AI**: A fine-tuned large language model on [etherscan](https://etherscan.io/) contracts 🦄 for generating smart contracts with minimal vulnerabilities. We employ Chain of Thought prompting and a critiquing LLM as a reinforcement learning agent to proactively spot and mitigate risks.
* **Gradient-Based Stiffness Optimization**: Leveraging finite element analysis with [FEniCS](https://fenicsproject.org/) to empirically evaluate and optimize the robustness of interlocking joints in manufacturing processes 🏭.
* **CipherP2P**: A Chrome extension that facilitates efficient peer-to-peer file sharing 📁. Developed in Golang, this project features WebRTC network, a simple UI, and a secure, TLS-encrypted file protocol.
